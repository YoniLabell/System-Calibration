# System-Calibration

To manage the production systems calibration process, we can design a software application with the following components:

Database (DB): We need a database to store information about the systems, calibration tests, and their statuses.

Functions: We'll implement functions to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database and other relevant tasks.

User Interface (UI): The UI will provide an overview of all the systems, their status, and testing time. It will allow users to add new systems and update calibration tests.

Let's start by creating a simple data model for the database:

Database Tables:

Systems

system_id (Primary Key)
system_name
system_type
CalibrationTests

test_id (Primary Key)
test_name

SystemCalibrationTests (Many-to-Many Relationship table)

system_id (Foreign Key - references Systems.system_id)
test_id (Foreign Key - references CalibrationTests.test_id)
last_calibration_date
test_interval
